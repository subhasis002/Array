// Array 
  - an array in java is a  datastructure that stores a collection of element of the same data in a contiguous memory locations,it's a fixed sized ,homogeneous collection of elements,meaning all elements must be in same type.
    example,
        int [] a=new inyt [6];
        it can  store oly integer value,
        And acces by their indexces.
// types of array
    In java,there are severals type of arrays 
   LIKE-1- one dimensional array[1D]
         A one dimensional array is a simple array that stores elements of same type array in a single row.
        example, 
         int [] a=new int [7];   
       -2-Multi-dimensional array -
        A multi-dimensional array is an array of arrays,where each element is itself an array,
        example,
        int [][] arr=new int [3][4];
       -3-jaggeed array
        a jagged array is a multi-dimensional array where each row has a differrent number of columns.
    example,
      int [][] jaggArray=new int [][] {{1,2},{3,4,5},{6}};
       -4-Arrays of objects 
        It store object of an array of a particular class.
       -5-Primitive type array
       which stores only primitive types ,such as int,double,boolean etc.
    example,
       int [] integer=new int [5];

       -6-Arrays of arrays,[2D].
        where each element is itself an array.
    example,
   int [][] arr= new int [3][4];
//  Array Declaration and initialization :
     1.Type(int) [] arrayName(arr) = new Type(int) [size];
     2.Type(int) arrayName(arr)[]=new Type(int)[size];
      
    - Array declaration specify the name,type,size of an array.
    - array sizes must be positive integers,cannot be negative.
    - array names follow the same naming convension of variable.
    - array declaration must be modified to declare multiple arrays of the same type

// basic array operation 
       1. Declaration 
       Declaring an array variable and specifying its type and  size.
       2. initialization
       Assignment values to the element of an array
       3.indexing
       Accessing a specific element of an array using its index.
       4.Assignment
       Assignment a new value to an exitsing elemet of an array.
       5.Traverse 
       iterating through all the elements of an array.
       for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
       System.out.println(arr[i]);}
       6.Serching 
        Finding a specific element in an array.
     int target= 10;
     boolean found =false;
     for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
      if (arr[i] == target){
       found = true;
       break;
      }
     }
     if(found){
     System.out.Println("target was found!");
     else 
     System.out.Println("not Found");}}
   7.Sorting
   Arranging the element in some order(like ascendiong or decending order).
   Arrays.Sort(arr);
   8. Insertion
   9. Deletion
   10.merging 
// Array Traversal
   
    Array traversal in java refers to the process of iterating throuh the elements of an array.Here are some ways to traverse an array in java.
 1.Using for loop 
 2.using enhanced for loop/for each loop
 3.Using while loop
 4.Using Do-while Loop
 5.Using java-8 Streams.
 THIS ARE SOME COMMON WAYS TO TRAVESE AN ARRAY IN JAVA....
